# Backend

Coming soon — backend services for Smart Plug AI.

This directory will host the backend API and infrastructure code. Expected components:

- FastAPI-based REST API for device management and data ingestion
- MQTT bridge or broker configuration for device telemetry
- InfluxDB or time-series storage configuration and ingestion scripts
- Cloud functions for processing and basic analytics
- Local development instructions (docker-compose for MQTT + backend)

Initial placeholder tasks:
- Add FastAPI skeleton and README instructions
- Add docker-compose for local MQTT + InfluxDB
- Document environment variables and secrets

Reference: See project plan for backend architecture and data flow.
